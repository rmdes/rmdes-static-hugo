All I can say is that, this [bluesky-invite-code-finder](https://github.com/sen0va/bluesky-invite-code-finder,) works ! #bluesky 
but before using it, apply the pull request to support the new invite format code. 

- Add your twitter bearer token (you need to create a twitter app)
- Add desired bsky username, make sure it's available
- Add your email

For some reason I could not, at first, login with the password I had set in the main.js file, so I went to reset my password, got sent an email from bluesky, changed to a new password and voilà !
