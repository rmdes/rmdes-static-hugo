This is interesting, but it doesn't represent the reality for one simple reason : 3 months in social media is a snapshot in a much more complicated issue. 

Second, the elephant in the room is the fact most of the societal harm done by big tech platforms (and their ever changing algorithms) has been done progressively in the last 15 years. The drill has been done already. A lost of the most impacted people are not even using Facebook daily anymore. 

The study feels like a a sample experiment done after the crime scene.
