First, they came for the refugees and migrants, and I did not speak out—because I was not one of them.

Then they came for trans people, LGBTQIA+ communities, and women's rights, and I did not speak out—because I thought my rights were secure.

Then they dismantled federal agencies like USAID,  
[eliminating 83% of its programs and terminating thousands of staff](https://apnews.com/article/bf442d62af67918a6fc5eee839074601).  
[This abrupt action halted critical global health and humanitarian initiatives, leaving millions without essential support](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/foreign-aid-budget-cuts-trump-starmer-kzf0jwczd).  
Yet, I did not speak out—because I did not work in public health.

Then they targeted universities:

[launching investigations into 60 institutions over allegations of antisemitism](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment),  
and [arresting students like Mahmoud Khalil for their political speech](https://www.theverge.com/policy/627185/columbia-ice-arrest-mahmoud-khalil-palestine-protest-surveillance).  
And still, I did not speak out—because I was not a student or faculty member.

Then they detained individuals like Jasmine Mooney,  
[a Canadian entrepreneur who was held in inhumane conditions while attempting to renew her visa](https://nypost.com/2025/03/14/us-news/canadian-american-pie-actress-detained-by-ice-while-applying-for-visa-at-southern-border/).  
Yet, I did not speak out—because I was not seeking entry.

Then they came for the political opponents, the judges, the police, and the federal workers who upheld the law, and I did not speak out—because I believed it wouldn't affect me.

Now, billionaires dismantle government agencies, silence watchdogs, and erode democratic institutions.

**And when they come for you, who will be left to speak?**
