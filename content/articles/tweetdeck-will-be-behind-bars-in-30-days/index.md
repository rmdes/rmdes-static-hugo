And now the veteran Tweetdeck is going behind Blue "Verified" jail in less than 30 days.. It's really great how Musk keeps destroying #Twitter

More people for the fediverse, like it or not, but this has been the best catalyzer to move people away from big tech.

Yes Meta will retain some of the bleeding, it's unavoidable! Better than Musk anyway. At this stage, everything should be done to empty Twitter.
