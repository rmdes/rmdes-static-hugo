it wouldn't be roasting, perhaps Trump wouldn't even be elected in the first place. 

I feel like even the [best](https://youtu.be/gRNeroeULyo?si=D6o9ou7AKAHQbHT9) comedians, commentators and opinionated individuals out there, all those not losing their north star, would greatly appreciate it if anything remotely as close to Carlin was alive today and dismantling whatever is the ongoing political/economic cast in power (not just in the USA)
