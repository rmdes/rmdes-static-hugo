# Rebuttal of Soteria International's Claims on the OKC Case


As a victim of the Ogyen Kunzang Chöling (OKC) cult and an advocate for justice, I find Soteria International's statements on the [OKC case](https://www.soteriainternational.org/ogyen-kunzang-choling-case-belgium) [deeply](https://www.soteriainternational.org/witch-hunt-effects-in-society-part-2-195) [troubling](https://www.soteriainternational.org/witch-hunt-effects-in-society-part-3). 


Their narrative not only misrepresents the reality of the abuses perpetrated by Robert Spatz and OKC leadership but also dismisses the voices of victims. Below is a detailed rebuttal of each of their claims.


---


## 1. **Soteria's Lack of Victim Engagement**


Soteria International bases its arguments on the narratives provided by OKC leadership, ignoring victims' experiences. 


**Victims’ Voices Silenced:**   


- Soteria never reached out to victims during its research. The only time a victim attempted to engage with Soteria, their concerns were dismissed in favor of OKC's leadership narrative.  


- Victims' testimonies, particularly those of children raised in the cult, expose the systematic abuse, coercion, and exploitation within OKC. These testimonies directly contradict Soteria’s claims.


**Contrary Evidence from Susan J. Palmer’s Research:**   
- Palmer interviewed several victims in 2016, including individuals who grew up in OKC. Their accounts revealed emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, directly challenging the "serenity" and "educational excellence" claims promoted by Soteria.  


- Palmer had to change her narrative and was even writing a new book that directly contradict previous research that she did on the matter, in fact she recognized to be an error, a mistake on her part to also limit her research to the OKC general secretary view point, in fact her approach should bluntly disqualify her as an expert on Children's inside cult altogether.

## 2. **Misrepresentation of Legal Proceedings**


Soteria downplays the legal findings against OKC and its leader, Robert Spatz.


**Criminal Convictions Omitted:**   


- In Belgium, Spatz was convicted in 2016 for **rape, physical abuse, financial exploitation, and money laundering**. 
Soteria fails to acknowledge these verdicts, portraying Spatz and OKC as victims of injustice.  
- In Belgium, Spatz was convicted in 2020 for **rape, physical abuse, financial exploitation, and money laundering**. Soteria fails to acknowledge these verdicts, portraying Spatz and OKC as victims of injustice.


**Ongoing Legal Cases in France:**   


- The French courts are still addressing allegations of financial fraud, abuse, and exploitation. These cases are grounded in substantial evidence, including victim testimonies and documented financial irregularities contrary to the 1997-2003 case in France, where the cult used children's minor of age to build the cult defense by using indoctrinated kids (we) as "food canon" to hide their crimes, crimes that these very children's 20 years later are denouncing in Court.


**"Reasonable Time" Argument Misused:**   


- Soteria criticizes the lengthy legal process, ignoring the complexity of cases involving systemic abuse and the need for thorough investigation to ensure justice for victims.


- But Soteria misses even more is how the cult and Robert Spats obstructed French, Belgium legal system with counter proceedings to slow down the courts ultimately benefiting from the "reasonable time" that elapsed since the police raid in 1997 ending up with light condemnation because "their rights", not the victims rights' had been abused.

## 3. **Framing of Raids as Overreach**


- Soteria frames the 1997 raids as excessive and unjustified, ignoring their context and necessity.For us, kids that were born inside the cult, even if took us a decade or more to realize, the police raid were the start of freedom, not only OKC was less harsh on the childrens and teenagers after the raid but ultimately it slowed down Robert Spatz grip on the adepts which ultimately allowed us to escape and rebuild our lives outside of the cult, ultimately seeking Justice. 


**Evidence-Based Actions:**   


- The raids were conducted in response to credible allegations of **rape, kidnapping, extortion, and torture**, supported by victim testimonies and other evidence. The scale of the operation was proportional to the severity of the allegations


**False Equivalence with Benign Groups:**   


- Unlike other spiritual communities cited by Soteria, OKC faced concrete allegations of abuse and criminal activity. This comparison trivializes the suffering of victims and undermines legitimate investigations.- **Protection of Victims:**


- The raids were critical to safeguarding children and adults from ongoing harm, as later court findings validated many of the allegations.

## 4. **Education and Child Welfare at Château de Soleil**


Soteria paints an idealized picture of the Château de Soleil school, ignoring documented abuses.


**Systematic Indoctrination and Abuse:**   


- Children were isolated, indoctrinated, and subjected to physical and sexual abuse. This is supported by multiple victim testimonies and Spatz's conviction for crimes against minors.


**Manipulated Educational Reports:**


- Claims of "academic excellence" were a façade to distract from the psychological harm inflicted on children. Victim testimonies reveal a lack of genuine education and an environment of fear and control.


**Court Findings on Abuse:**


- Contrary to Soteria's narrative, the Belgian courts found Spatz guilty of crimes against children, invalidating their claims of a safe and nurturing environment.


- There is very valid arguments to say that the French courts will do the same and that Robert Spatz and the OKC direction may very well finally face Justice in France in a way that was never possible before, [we](https://okcinfo.chardonsbleus.org), the victims [finally managed](https://chardonsbleus.org) to speak and gain the right to exist in a judicial instructions that actually take into account the victims.

## 5. **Financial Mismanagement and Exploitation**


Soteria dismisses financial irregularities as baseless, ignoring evidence of exploitation.And of course Soteria does not know half of the truth here, since even the justice systems could not fully charge Robert Spatz for the extent of the fraud he and OKC organized for decades before the 90's


**Coercion of Members:**   


- OKC members were pressured into donating large sums, funding Spatz's lavish lifestyle. Victims described severe financial and psychological manipulation.


- Financial records uncovered in court showed irregularities, including money laundering and misuse of funds.


**Court-Ordered Financial Audits:**


- Independent audits revealed significant financial misconduct, contradicting Soteria's portrayal of OKC as financially transparent.


---


## 6. **Freedom of Religion Misused as a Shield**


Soteria conflates legitimate religious freedom with the prosecution of criminal behavior.


**Crimes Beyond Religious Practices:**   


- The allegations against OKC involve rape, child abuse, financial fraud, and other crimes. These are not religious practices but violations of basic human rights.


**Selective Defense:**   


- Soteria focuses on defending OKC leadership while ignoring the rights of victims. Religious freedom cannot shield individuals from accountability for crimes.


**Distinction from Other Cases:**   


- Unlike other spiritual communities cited by Soteria, OKC faced substantial evidence of criminal activity, making their inclusion in broader narratives of religious discrimination inappropriate.


---


## 7. **Historical and Structural Criticism of Soteria**


Soteria's narrative exhibits a clear bias toward protecting institutions over individuals.


**Imbalanced Advocacy:**
- By prioritizing OKC leadership's narrative, Soteria disregards victims’ experiences and the outcomes of thorough judicial processes.


**Oversight of Power Dynamics:**   


- Soteria's arguments fail to address the abusive power dynamics within OKC, where Spatz wielded unchecked authority, leading to systemic harm.


---
## Conclusion


Soteria International's claims about the OKC case represent a dangerously one-sided and misleading narrative that erases the suffering of victims and dismisses credible judicial findings. As a victim, I find their arguments not only deeply offensive but also profoundly irresponsible. The well-documented abuse, exploitation, and harm caused by OKC and its leader, Robert Spatz, cannot and must not be obscured under the guise of protecting religious freedom. Justice must unequivocally prioritize the voices of the harmed over the preservation of abusive institutions.


By systematically siding with abusers, Soteria International has positioned itself as part of the problem. Their defense of OKC does not serve "spiritual rights" or "human rights" but instead reinforces the impunity of criminal behavior under the pretense of religious liberty. Organizations like Soteria, which consistently prioritize the narratives of perpetrators over those of survivors, fail to uphold the fundamental principles of justice and accountability. Such pseudo-NGOs should be defunded and disbanded, as their actions enable systemic abuse and undermine the very human rights they claim to protect.
