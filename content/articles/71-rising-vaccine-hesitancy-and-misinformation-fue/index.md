The global anti-vaccine movement, fueled by COVID-19 misinformation, continues to grow. A survey shows declining U.S. vaccine confidence since April 2021. Misinformation includes false links between vaccines and autism, infertility, and ingredient safety concerns. 

Health myths have led to 319,000 preventable COVID-19 deaths and daily economic losses of $50-300 million in the U.S. 

The spread is aided by declining trust in science and selective social media exposure.
