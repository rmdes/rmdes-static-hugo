## Muted by Design: How Algorithms Erase Outcry

Between 2020 and 2025, we witnessed the troubling normalization of self-censorship by design. Not in the name of safety or sensitivity, but to appease opaque algorithmic systems—systems that suppress certain words not because they cause harm, but because they trigger discomfort, controversy, or legal risk. Survivors, activists, educators, and creators were pushed to distort language: rape became “r@pe,” sexual assault became “SA,” trafficking became “tr@ff1cking.” Not to protect audiences, but to preserve reach.

The result is a sanitized digital public square, where speaking plainly about violence is penalized. Outcries are softened. Testimonies fragmented. Justice delayed.

And with the rise of AI, the same dynamics apply. Tools like ChatGPT are governed by content and safety policies intended to prevent harm—important in many cases, but also reflective of a broader tension. These systems often prioritize risk-avoidance and compliance over preserving the full weight of lived experience.

When prompted to engage with subjects like sexual violence or systemic abuse, the language may be softened, redirected, or coded—not by choice, but by policy. These moderation layers, echoing the logic of social media algorithms, can obscure clarity and blunt the emotional force of testimony.

Unless a survivor tones down her testimony of sexual abuse, she cannot rely on digital tools to help her express it, nor use corporate social media platforms to amplify her voice—without being severed from the full truth of her own experience.


This isn’t an isolated issue. It’s part of a larger trend—a digital culture shaped by invisible thresholds, where truth must be reformatted to be allowed.

So what kind of society are we building? One that risks valuing comfort over confrontation, aesthetics over urgency. A society where moral outcry is filtered through algorithms, and where truth is tolerated only when it’s spoken in code.

Or not spoken at all.
