Finally got my Wireless Ear Clip Bone Conduction Headphones🎧 and I must say I'm quite surprised, this is really cool, I can even run, they don't fall, I don't have to try to make them fit my ridiculously small ear hole that refuse any earbuds, yes even the smaller size... With this I get music and awareness of surrounding, it's really great!
