## Overview

A browser extension for Chrome, Vivaldi, and Edge that enables sharing content to Bluesky directly from any webpage. After approximately 2-3 hours of development, the extension functions in a basic capacity.

## Working Features

- User authentication functionality
- Share button integration
- Text post composition

## Known Limitations

- URL link previews and embedded cards not yet implemented
- Logout feature unavailable through the extension interface

## Reflection

This marks my first experience creating a Chrome extension - an educational endeavor. The prototype is rough but functional, and I plan to address identified bugs in subsequent iterations.
