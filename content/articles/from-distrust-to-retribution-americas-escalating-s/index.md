The core problem in the 🇺🇸 right now is trust in information, democracy, institutions.

 Whatever is put forward, whether a “manifesto,” “killer’s note,” or shooting suspect’s story, no matter what the authorities claim, the public has come to believe that it’s all manipulated. 

That distrust is being weaponized by the alt-right / MAGA crowd, and it won’t be long before they demand retribution, for real or imagined.

Because the current administration is seen as deeply biased, compromised, even complicit by many, every statement, every slip, every omission becomes fuel. Whether intentional or not, its behavior and rhetoric will stoke the flames and lead to real retribution.

There’s only one way to halt this descent: the people, those not yet indoctrinated, those still able to think beyond rage, must step forward.
 
Those sections of society that are not caught up in fear, indoctrination and fury need to raise clear, honest voices. Without that, with a death like Charlie Kirk’s hanging over everything, we’re not just witnessing a case: we’re seeing a tipping point.
