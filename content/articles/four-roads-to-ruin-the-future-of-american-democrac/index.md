In the aftermath of the "Signalgate" scandal and economic freefall, President Donald J. Trump's administration teeters on the edge of authoritarian ambition. With the Wisconsin Supreme Court election just days away and Project 2025 serving as the ideological and operational blueprint, the regime accelerates its grip on power.


This four-part fiction explores four possible futures unfolding between now and 2029, each rooted in real legislative, economic, and political dynamics at play today.

## Part I: The Emergency That Never Ends 2025-2027: From Chaos to Control

In August 2025, the Dow plummets below 20,000. Inflation spikes, unemployment soars. Amid public panic, a coordinated domestic terror attack on the Port of Los Angeles is blamed on "Antifa extremists and international saboteurs." The administration invokes the National Emergencies Act and declares martial law in select Democratic-run cities.

Federal troops—empowered by the Insurrection Act—are deployed to Oakland, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Civil liberties are suspended under a new Presidential Emergency Directive drafted with Project 2025 guidelines. Trump’s DOJ detains activists and journalists under new domestic security legislation modeled on the Patriot Act.

The 2026 Midterms are "postponed" due to national instability. The Department of Homeland Security assumes oversight of the Federal Election Commission, citing cybersecurity threats. Fox News celebrates the move as “a bold defense of national sovereignty.” MSNBC is taken off air for refusing to comply with broadcast “patriotism guidelines.”

Trump extends his term using executive emergency authority. The Supreme Court, now firmly conservative after the retirement of Justice Sotomayor and a rushed appointment of a Liberty Caucus judge, upholds the legality of the extension. Protests erupt—but are quelled by a newly established Federal Civil Order Guard, led by former Blackwater contractors.



## Part II: The Third Term Amendment 2025-2029: Democracy Revised, Permanently

In 2025, Tennessee Congressman Andy Ogles revives a bill to repeal the 22nd Amendment. With the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 network behind him and massive donor support from new tech-libertarian PACs, the bill garners early traction.

The economic crisis deepens, and the administration frames Trump as the “only figure of stability” capable of managing the storm. By late 2026, enough red-state legislatures signal their willingness to ratify a proposed constitutional amendment. Trump begins hosting nightly rallies under the banner “Restore American Glory — Forever.”

After the GOP sweeps the 2026 Midterms in part due to voter suppression laws and gerrymandering, the Amendment passes both houses of Congress. Three-quarters of states ratify it within 18 months, many under pressure from federal funding threats or intelligence blackmail campaigns led by a retooled NSA.

In 2028, Trump runs for—and wins—a third term against a splintered opposition led by a centrist Democrat and a progressive independent. He promises this will be his “last, greatest term,” but hints he may step aside “only if America is finally great again.”



## Part III: The Chaos Engine 2026: Manufactured Unrest as Political Leverage

As economic desperation festers, mass protests erupt in major cities—sparked by evictions, food shortages, and joblessness. Leaked documents later show DHS agents and MAGA-aligned militias embedded in the crowds, inciting violence.

Trump declares a “domestic insurgency” underway. Governors requesting federal help are only aided if they agree to new federal voter roll revisions and “electoral integrity partnerships,” effectively handing control to Trump’s Federal Voting Oversight Office (FVOO).

By 2027, the FVOO has the power to nullify state-certified elections it deems compromised. In 2028, several blue states are told their electoral votes “will not be counted until audits conclude.” The chaos delays results for weeks. Trump remains in power through executive fiat, claiming the audit process must finish before a peaceful transfer of power can occur.


## Part IV: The Global Distraction Gambit 2027-2029: Foreign Conflict as a Domestic Power Play

With civil discourse breaking down and Trump’s approval below 35%, his administration escalates military involvement in Taiwan, citing threats to global freedom. Congress is bypassed using the War Powers Resolution loopholes.

The crisis justifies a National Unity Government, where elections are suspended indefinitely under wartime provisions. Biden-era diplomatic pacts are nullified. NATO, disillusioned, prepares for an American exit. Fox News frames the moment as “America’s last stand against the globalist Axis.”

Domestically, protests are outlawed under the War Disruption Prevention Act. Thousands are arrested. Universities are nationalized under the guise of training future wartime leaders. Evangelical mega-churches openly proclaim Trump as “anointed by divine will to lead until the Second Coming.”

By 2029, the United States is effectively under a perpetual emergency regime. Trump announces the creation of a National Succession Committee “to ensure continuity if the anointed must depart.” His daughter Ivanka is named as first in line.

## The V path : 

**The Abundance Rebellion: How Democracy Fought Back**


**Prologue: The Last Line Held**


April 2025. The Wisconsin Supreme Court race was supposed to be quiet—a low-turnout affair, a predictable conservative win financed by Elon Musk’s $22 million war chest. Brad Schimel, the MAGA-backed candidate, was expected to glide into power.


But something happened.


A coalition of angry teachers, Gen Z organizers, disillusioned suburban moms, and working-class Black and Latino voters coalesced around Susan Crawford, a former public defender who refused to be bought. She spoke not about Trump, but about roads, housing, insulin prices, and the right to vote. People listened.


When she won—despite record spending and smear campaigns—it wasn’t just a victory. It was a rupture. The MAGA machine could be beaten. Musk’s money could fail. And perhaps more importantly, Democrats saw something they hadn’t seen in years: a path forward not led by a messiah, but by material politics.


---


**Chapter 1: The Fire We Forgot**


In the weeks following Crawford’s win, a strange energy ignited across Democratic circles—not the usual donor emails and celebrity endorsements, but something older, hungrier. County organizers in Michigan began hosting "Fix It Fairs," where residents pitched real municipal problems and brainstormed budget-neutral solutions. In Arizona, Democrats scrapped their national messaging and started airing ads in Diné Bizaad.


But it was in Pennsylvania where the movement found its spine.


Pittsburgh city councilor Malik Reyes, 28, went viral after livestreaming a housing rezoning meeting where he dismantled NIMBY resistance by walking viewers—step by step—through the data. "We don’t need hope. We need permits," he told his audience of 4 million. Within days, hundreds of local officials across the country started doing the same.


When Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson dropped Abundance: The Blueprint to Rebuild America, it wasn’t treated like a thinkpiece—it was read like a handbook. Twitter turned excerpts into infographics. TikTokers adapted the regulatory reform sections into explainers. A new politics was being born, one not of personalities, but of function.



---


**Chapter 2: Midterms and the Machinery of Change**


The 2026 Midterms became a litmus test.


Trump, emboldened by economic panic and controlled media, promised a “Decade of Dominion.” His rallies fused Pentecostal fervor with imperial rhetoric. MAGA governors purged voter rolls. States like Georgia passed laws requiring biometric scans to vote, sparking outrage and lawsuits.


But Democrats, abandoning presidential savior fantasies, focused on the ground. They ran plumbers, nurses, single dads. They canvassed in Korean, Tagalog, Haitian Creole. In states where they still held governorships, they used executive orders to speed housing construction, legalize modular factory builds, and digitize permit offices.


The night of the Midterms, the results were stunning. Democrats flipped the House. They held the Senate with two unexpected wins—in Texas and Florida. A map that had long trended red lit up with new coalitions.


And then came the files.


---


**Chapter 3: The Whistle and the Wreckage**


In early 2027, a disgruntled Department of Commerce staffer, Shilpa Mani, leaked documents showing Trump’s direct involvement in awarding oil contracts to Saudi firms in exchange for personal bailouts of his failing real estate ventures.


The evidence was damning: flight logs, burner phones, encrypted Signal messages between Trump, Jared Kushner, and a Saudi intermediary linked to the Khashoggi assassination. A secret PAC, “Freedom Flow,” had funneled tens of millions into swing-state races using shell companies.


The impeachment proceedings were immediate. What was different this time? Democrats had numbers—and the will. But more importantly, the public was ready. The hearings were watched by more people than the Super Bowl. Rage and relief poured through the nation.


Faced with criminal indictment and public fury, Trump resigned. His speech from Mar-a-Lago—rambling, vengeful, tearful—ended not with defiance, but with a plea for mercy.


---


**Chapter 4: The Reckoning and the Rising**


2028 became the year America remembered itself.


Voting registration hit 91%. New voter coalitions emerged: the “Care Economy Voters” (nurses, educators, elder-care workers), the “Climate Builders” (green-tech laborers), and the “Reconstruction Bloc” (immigrants and rural dwellers demanding infrastructure).


Meanwhile, Elon Musk—already under federal scrutiny for election interference—was arrested by the DOJ for securities fraud and racketeering. His political empire crumbled overnight. So did the aura of invincibility around GOP mega-donors.


In cities and counties, Democrats built what they called “abundance councils,” civilian panels that liaised with local governments to identify blockages and streamline fixes. By November, Americans weren’t just voting. They were governing.


The election was a landslide. The House, the Senate, the White House—won. The electoral map didn’t just shift. It reset.


---


**Epilogue: No More Gods, Just Neighbors**



No one leader emerged as the face of the movement. There was no Obama, no FDR. But there was a new ethos: governance as a collective craft, democracy as maintenance, not mythology.



And when the next crisis came—and it did—the nation didn’t wait for permission to respond. Because abundance, they’d learned, wasn’t about having more

It was about making sure everyone had enough—and that no one man ever held everything again.


History isn't made by watching the world crumble. 

Together, we can beat tyrants. 

Divided, we get ruled by Kings and Elites. 

What will you do?
