At times, we find ourselves undertaking arduous and trying tasks. We embark on these endeavors not because we possess a clear understanding of what lies ahead, but rather due to our ignorance of the obstacles that lay ahead. 

It's comparable to running a marathon, where we hold onto a steadfast belief in our ability to accomplish it, despite having no conception of the sheer effort required. 

It seems that the courage required to take on such challenges can only manifest when we remain oblivious to the sacrifices and tribulations that await us.

Only when we complete these trials can we truly grasp the magnitude of our accomplishment. 

But with this understanding also comes a sense of lucid discernment, for the sacrifices we were forced to make along the way.

And the value of the entire journey.
