Well well well, #Spoutible launch its #android app [play.google.com/store/app...](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spoutible)

The one thing I like about all this? Is that a multitude of initiatives are disrupting the likes of Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and while my home is on my blog, all this competition and diversion from the big tech monopolies can only be good for the internet!
