In the second term of the Trump elected regime, a deliberate strategy has emerged: inundate the media landscape with rapid, successive actions to outpace scrutiny and erode institutional checks. This approach not only overwhelms journalistic capacities but also pressures U.S. institutions to compromise their constitutional responsibilities.

## A Deluge of Deportations

Central to this strategy is the imposition of stringent daily arrest quotas on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Each of ICE's 25 field offices has been directed to execute at least 75 arrests daily, aiming for a nationwide total of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests per day. This aggressive target significantly increases the likelihood of detaining individuals without criminal histories, as the focus shifts from quality to quantity in enforcement actions.

Compounding this, the administration has resurrected the Alien Enemies Act of 1798—a law historically invoked during declared wars—to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. This application is unprecedented in peacetime and has been used to justify mass deportations without standard due process, raising significant legal and ethical concerns.

## Undermining Judicial Authority

The administration's rapid actions have often outpaced judicial interventions. In a notable instance, federal Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order to halt deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Despite this, the administration proceeded with deportations, arguing that the judge's verbal order lacked enforceability. This defiance underscores a troubling disregard for judicial authority and the rule of law. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.G.G._v._Trump](J.G.G. v. Trump)

Further exacerbating tensions, President Trump has publicly criticized judges who oppose his policies, labeling them as "weak and ineffective." Such rhetoric not only undermines the judiciary's role but also fosters an environment where constitutional checks are viewed as obstacles rather than essential components of governance.

## The Psychological Toll of Constant Crisis

This relentless pace of policy implementation and institutional confrontation creates a state of perpetual crisis. The media, inundated with rapid developments, struggles to provide comprehensive coverage, leading to fragmented public understanding. Consequently, the populace may experience desensitization, fatigue, and a sense of helplessness, diminishing civic engagement and resistance.

This phenomenon aligns with the concept of "flooding the zone," where overwhelming the information space with continuous, often conflicting narratives, hampers critical analysis and accountability. By the time one issue is addressed, several others have already emerged, creating a cycle that benefits those in power by diluting opposition and scrutiny.

## Turning the Tide Through Collective Action

The Trump administration's strategy of overwhelming media channels and undermining institutional checks poses a significant threat to democratic norms and the rule of law. By enforcing aggressive deportation quotas and circumventing judicial orders, the administration not only disrupts the lives of countless individuals but also challenges the foundational principles of accountability and constitutional governance.

However, history teaches us that sustained, grassroots political movements can counteract authoritarian tendencies. Inspired by the legacy of civil rights leaders like John Lewis, who advocated for "good trouble," Americans are called to engage in persistent, courageous, and broad-based opposition.

Here are actionable steps to resist and reclaim democratic values:

## the 3.5% Rule 

This idea is based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, who studied over 300 nonviolent and violent resistance campaigns between 1900 and 2006.

### Key Findings of the 3.5% Rule

1. Nonviolent movements are more effective than violent ones – Historically, nonviolent protests succeeded twice as often as violent uprisings in toppling governments or winning major concessions.
2. 3.5% of the population is the tipping point – No major resistance movement that mobilized at least 3.5% of the population in sustained, active protest has failed.
3. Engagement, not just support, is key – It’s not enough for a majority to “agree” with a cause; the crucial factor is how many people are actively participating—marching, organizing, striking, and disrupting the system.
4. Governments struggle to repress mass nonviolent movements – Unlike armed uprisings, nonviolent movements make it harder for governments to justify brutal crackdowns, leading to defections from police, military, and elites.

###Examples of the 3.5% Rule in Action

• Serbian Revolution 2000 – The Otpor! movement mobilized less than 5% of the Serbian population and successfully overthrew dictator Slobodan Milošević through mass protests and strikes.
• Philippines’ People Power Movement 1986 – Around 2 million Filipinos (about 3.5% of the population) flooded the streets, leading to the fall of dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
• Sudan 2019 – Sustained mass protests led by students, professionals, and workers forced Sudan’s military to remove dictator Omar al-Bashir after 30 years in power.

🚨This rule highlights that we don’t need a majority of people to rise up—we just need a committed, organized minority. If just 3.5% actively protested and disrupted the system, major political shifts would become unavoidable.

The challenge? Overcoming apathy and getting people to take action. History shows that once a movement reaches this threshold, victory is almost inevitable.

- **Join Grassroots Movements**: Engage with organizations like the [50501 movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50501_movement), [Indivisible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indivisible_movement), and [March On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_On_%28organization%29) that are mobilizing nationwide protests and advocating for policy changes.

- **Support Labor Unions**: Strengthen collective bargaining and workers' rights to counteract economic policies that favor the wealthy elite. Supporting unions can shift political power by uniting workers around their economic interests. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/14/trump-unions-fighting-back](Want to defeat Trump? Support unions)

- **Participate in Nonviolent Direct Actions**: Engage in peaceful protests, sit-ins, and other forms of civil disobedience to draw attention to injustices and demand change. [https://wagingnonviolence.org/cnv/2019/09/good-trouble/](Nonviolent direct action and the good kind of trouble that changes ...)

- **Educate and Mobilize Voters**: Work to increase voter turnout, especially among marginalized communities, by organizing voter registration drives and educating citizens about their rights. Initiatives like [March On's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_On_%28organization%29) "March on the Polls" aim to increase voter turnout and change the narrative around voting and civic participation.

- **Hold Elected Officials Accountable**: Contact your representatives to express your concerns, attend town hall meetings, and demand that they uphold their oaths to the Constitution.

- **Leverage Digital Platforms**: Utilize social media and online tools to spread awareness, organize events, and connect with like-minded individuals committed to democratic principles.

By embracing these strategies and fostering a culture of active citizenship, Americans can work collectively to challenge authoritarianism and restore the integrity of democratic institutions. The path forward requires resilience, unity, and an unwavering commitment to justice and equality.

By the way, WTF is Congress doing?
