For background on the OKC-Spatz case from 1997-2022 check out this [link](https://okcinfo.chardonsbleus.org/en)

Since 2017, the OKC-Spatz case has been under investigation in France. After years of gathering evidence and testimonies, we are approaching a critical turning point. By the end of this year, a new investigative judge will take over the case. This transition brings both urgency and risk. If we fail to finalize the investigation before the handover, the momentum we’ve built could stall—perhaps indefinitely.

The victims in this case have already endured decades of trauma, legal battles, and endless waiting. Now, with only a few months left, our legal team is working tirelessly to close the investigation and prepare the case for trial.

But the work required is enormous. Our two dedicated lawyers must comb through thousands of pages of court documents from prior cases involving OKC—both in France (1997–2003) and Belgium (1997–2022). This research is essential to present a comprehensive argument that ensures the case proceeds, even with the change in magistrate.

At the heart of this case are six new plaintiffs who have stepped forward, despite their fears and the heavy emotional toll, to fight for justice. These survivors were born into OKC, raised in its oppressive environment, and subjected to physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. They have fought to rebuild their lives after escaping the sect, but the cost of justice remains out of reach.

They can’t afford legal fees. They can’t win this battle alone. That’s why Chardons Bleus exists—to ensure that no survivor is left behind, and to give them the financial support they need to face one of the most traumatizing systems of all: the justice system.

But let’s be clear—this is not just their fight. It’s a fight for all of us who believe that justice should not depend on wealth, and that no abuser should escape accountability.

Without the funds to cover legal costs, there will be no trial. Robert Spatz, also known as Lama Kunzang, and his accomplices could once again evade justice—just as they have in the past. Survivors have done their part by filing complaints and becoming civil parties in the case—a process that, in itself, is traumatizing and retraumatizing.

Now it’s our turn to stand with them.

We’ve already raised €3,079, but our next goal is €12,439. This amount will allow our lawyers to complete the final stages of preparation and deliver a summary note strong enough to push the case toward trial—despite the change of magistrate.

For these survivors, the OKC-Spatz case represents more than just legal accountability. It’s a chance to finally be heard, to affirm that what happened to them matters, and to send a clear message that abuse disguised as spirituality will no longer be tolerated.

But we can’t do it without you.

If you’ve been following this case, you already know what’s at stake. You know the courage it took for these survivors to come forward. You know the cost of silence.

Now, we need your help to speak louder than ever.

This isn’t just about one case—it’s about sending a message to every survivor of cult abuse that they are not alone and that justice, no matter how delayed, is within reach.

Let’s prove that justice isn’t just for the wealthy—it’s for everyone who dares to fight for it.

Thank you for standing with us. 💙
