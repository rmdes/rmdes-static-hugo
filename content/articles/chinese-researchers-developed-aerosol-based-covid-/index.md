Chinese researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed an aerosol-based Covid-19 vaccine, delivering microcapsules directly to the lungs. The vaccine, tested on animals, produced a sustained immune response with a single dose. It targets respiratory infections and could combat the Omicron variant. The dry, powdered vaccine remains stable at room temperature for over a month. The delivery platform is cost-effective and non-invasive, potentially aiding remote areas.
