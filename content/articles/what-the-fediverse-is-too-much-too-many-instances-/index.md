Looking for a way to handle many different fediverse tools such as mastodon, lemmy/kbin, pixelfed and what not all from one single place : [ferdium.org](https://ferdium.org/)
Use Ferdium custom sources and prep it to have these different tools accessible in one shot, it's just much easier to manage the diversity of tools or instances you might want to try until you settle.
