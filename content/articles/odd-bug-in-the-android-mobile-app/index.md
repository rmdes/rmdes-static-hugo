I'm trying to understand.... why should I have to select my default blog when I want to publish?

The selector (in the official android app) is always positioned on my test blog which I mostly never use or only to test theme changes...  so if I'm distracted I might publish to my test blog..it's.. Annoying... No issue when using the browser. 

Is this related to a misconfig on my side? [@manton.org](http://manton.org)
