I was born on October 29, 1980, which technically places me in Generation X, which spans those born from 1965 to 1980.

So, while technically I would fall into Generation X, I may identify more with Millennial characteristics, given I'm on the very edge of these generational divisions.

This is all very subjective of course but often, I do feel in between two periods while not belonging to any of them for all kinds of reasons.

Are you also in between?
