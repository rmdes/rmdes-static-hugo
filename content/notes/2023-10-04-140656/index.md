Hi [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton) did anything changed on how to add a domain to one's blog?

I'm trying to add a already registered domain to saskeets.micro.blog but I can't find where to input my domain, it always pushes me to buy a new domain.. it doesn't make sense, i don't remember it was like this before🤔
