Cross-posting on #microblog works fine but there is an issue on #android when the "share to Micro.blog" android share is used, the small wheel bottom right allowing you to categorize and tune cross-posting targets disappear.

I have to fully close micro.blog to be able to see it again and I have to open the app without using the share to feature for the wheel to come back.

If I don't.. It's going to cross-post everywhere without allowing me to tune it [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton)
