Absolutely not surprised by Musk exit from US government role. 

The Tax bill is just an excuse

Musk is just groking how foolish, naive and ignorant his whole approach was and cannot phantom the idea that he failed, so he's using the Tax bill to [exit](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/29/elon-musk-announces-exit-from-us-government-role-after-breaking-with-trump-on-tax-bill).

More interesting take from [@emptywheel.bsky.social](http://emptywheel.bsky.social)

This may be an attempt to preserve the damage Elon did to government, up to and including the data consolidation that DOGE carried out.
