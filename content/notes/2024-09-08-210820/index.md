Moving my [HPZ820](https://www.studiodaily.com/2012/08/hp-z820-workstation/) workstation to #Fedora (from Arch) getting tired of messing with things, I just want things to work and be smooth 😅
About to drop #hyprland on that old beast and see how things go 🤗
Gotta buy more RAM for this thing, it's still only at 16GB which for these days is not optimal.
