I read this some 20 years ago : [Stranger in a Strange Land](https://micro.blog/books/9780441788385) by Robert A. Heinlein 📚 and I find it fascinating how much I missed parts of it, I also noticed how it influenced me, how I took upon myself to learn and "grok" to discover the world, well, part of it at least :)
