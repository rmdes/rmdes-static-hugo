Interesting but I wish I could build this with my existing feed reader (FreshRSS,Miniflux) we need self-hosted algorithms! 

Yakread uses a recommendation algorithm/"AI" to help you pick things to read. It's designed to make reading long-form content as effortless as scrolling Twitter, while still leaving you in control of what you read.
