I bed early because my brain woke up at 3 AM, like suddenly my sleep stopped, my eyes opened and I knew exactly what to do : 

a #python & #javascript challenge I was stuck working since a few days solved, in my head, while I was asleep. 

Spent the day implementing it, it works!

Am I okay doctor?
