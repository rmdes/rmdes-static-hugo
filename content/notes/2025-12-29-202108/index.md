So ... I have been busy contributing to [this](http://v2.osintukraine.com)

tldr: real-time #telegram archive of the Russian War against Ukraine.

It's 100% built with Claude Code in a bit more than 2 months 

it's near 200.000 lines of #python code, without counting with [documentation](https://v2.osintukraine.com/platform-docs) of course. 

check it out !
