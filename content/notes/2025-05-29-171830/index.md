Found an odd bug on the Android app for microblog [@manton](https://micro.blog/manton)

If when editing a new post I manually add a Summary, this summary becomes the summary of future posts as well.. And even replace the opengraph description of the links from the future posts I share..

apparently, deleting this summary is hard
