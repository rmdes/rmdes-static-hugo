I'm using OpenAI Whisper (locally, without access to cloud) to transcribe 3h of French audio recording into text. 

I'm actually really impressed.
It's not fast but it's doing the job.

I had to amplify the audio signal +3db to increase the amplitude but other than that it's amazing.

Very precise.
